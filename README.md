# Fundamentals & Geo‑Trig Projects

A collection of projects focusing on fundamentals (algebra, geometry, trigonometry) and related explorations — created by NickAlvarez20 as learning and portfolio work.

## About

This repository contains a set of educational and exploratory projects in mathematics and programming, particularly centered on geometry, trigonometry, and foundational computational techniques. Each project is intended to help reinforce theoretical mathematical concepts through hands‑on implementation (in Python, or another language as applicable).

Use this repository to browse example problems, algorithms, visualizations, or small apps that relate to geometric and trigonometric topics. It’s meant both as a learning tool and a portfolio reference.

## Projects

Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of sample project topics in this repo:

- Geometry problem solvers (e.g. area, perimeter, angles)  
- Trigonometric function explorations and visualizations  
- Interactive or script‑based tools for geometric construction  
- Integrations of math and programming (e.g. algorithmic geometry)  

*(For a complete list of projects, see the directory listing in the repo.)*

## Prerequisites

To run or modify most projects, you’ll generally need:

- Python 3.x (or the language version used in the project)  
- Standard math / plotting libraries (e.g. `math`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`)  
- A command line / terminal environment  
- Basic familiarity with algebra, geometry, and trigonometry  

If any particular project requires extra dependencies (e.g. a specialized library), that will be documented in the project’s subfolder.

## Getting Started / Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/FundamentalsAndGeoTrigProjects.git
   cd FundamentalsAndGeoTrigProjects
````

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install any required dependencies (if listed in a `requirements.txt` or in project subfolders):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each project in the repo typically comes with its own entrypoint script or notebook. For example:

```bash
cd geometry_project_foo
python main.py
```

Or open a Jupyter notebook in the project folder:

```bash
jupyter notebook project_notebook.ipynb
```

Check each individual project folder for README or usage instructions.

Here’s a hypothetical example for a “triangle solver”:

```bash
cd triangle_solver
python triangle_solver.py
# The program might prompt you to enter side lengths or angles
```

## Structure & Organization

A possible layout might look like:

```
/
├── geometry_basics/
│   ├── area_calc.py
│   └── angle_visualization.ipynb
├── trig_explorations/
│   ├── sine_wave_plot.py
│   └── unit_circle_demo.ipynb
├── utils/  
│   └── geometry_helpers.py
└── README.md
```

* Each topic area or project has its own folder
* Shared utilities or helper code may live in a `utils/` or `common/` folder
* Individual projects may include their own README or documentation

## Learning Outcomes

Working through these projects, you may:

* Strengthen your understanding of geometric and trigonometric concepts
* Learn to translate math into code (algorithms, functions, visualizations)
* Practice structuring a multi-project repo
* Gain experience with Python scripting, data visualization, and modular design

## Contributing

This is primarily a personal learning / portfolio repository, so formal contributions aren’t required. However, if you spot bugs, have project ideas, or want to add improvements, feel free to:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Submit a pull request

Please include clear explanations of your changes and test any new code.
